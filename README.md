## SupplyChainDashboard

Hello Everyone, 

I made this Supply Chain Management Dashboard in Tableau with the provided dataset.

## Problem Statement

The goal of this Tableau Dashboard is to provide a comprehensive overview of company's supply chain operations, helping us to analyze and optimize processes, forecast demand, manage inventory, and evaluate supplier performance.

## Sections in the Report

**Report has multiple dashboards and a data story to visualize key performance metrics**

- Report data can be filtered by Country, Products, Segments or Year to show particular data.

- Report has filters on right hand side to slice the data and see the visualization.

- Report has cards to analyse Sales/Profit by country, Gross Sales vs Discounts, Discount Bands, Sales and Profit Trend overtime.

- Report has a bar chart to visualize sales and profits by country. Profits are visualized by colour gradient and Sales by height of the bars.

- Report has a bubble chart to visualize how gross sales performed on discounts

- Report has line charts to visualize sales and profits trend over time. 

- And Lastly, Report has a heat map to show discount bands for all products with total sales visualized as colour gradient.
